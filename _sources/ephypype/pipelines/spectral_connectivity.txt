Connectivity pipeline
=====================

The connectivity pipeline wraps spectral connectivity functions of MNE, as well as plot_circular_connectivity.

The connectivity pipeline is implemented by the function :py:func:`create_pipeline_time_series_to_spectral_connectivity <neuropype_ephy.pipelines.preproc_meeg.create_pipeline_time_series_to_spectral_connectivity>`
